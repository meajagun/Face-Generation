# Face-Generation
Project Face Generation using DCGAN to generate new realistic face images
This project describes how to define and train a DCGAN using a dataset of faces to generate realistic face images using a generator network.

## Steps in the project involve the following:
- Getting the data
- Preprocessing the Data
- Creating the DataLoader
- Defining the Discriminator and Generator Model 
- Initializing the weights of the network
- Building the complete network
- Calculating the Discriminator and Generator Losses
- Setting the Optimizers
- Training the Network
- Generator samples images of new Faces from the Training
